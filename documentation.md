## Description of Game

Hello World: A Wholesome Adventure is about finding a robot who needs to be returned to their creator. The robot builds on several traits such as kindness, love, happiness, and knowledge. Throughout the story, the player can make decisions that helps develop the robot's personalities. Different choices lead to different paths.

The program is a text adventure that allows the user to input a combination of commands and the description of the surroundings. For example, if the highlighted keywords in the text are "apple" and "flower" and the commands include "touch" and "look," then the options "touch flower" and "look apple" are two of the choices available for input. If the user types in "look at apple" or "touch the flower," the program is designed to accept the inputs as well. If any invalid inputs are given, then the user is told to try again.

The code also involves using Colorama to color specific words and lines of text to help give hints to the user. Any items or places that are able to be interacted with are colored, as well as important events or things to keep note of. The user is able to input "help" as well in order to gain insight into what to do next. 

In order to develop the traits of the robot, a class system is used. It is updated and changed depending on the choices made, and can be viewed in certain scenes by the input "use phone." If the user does not have enough money, then some features of the game are locked. In the future, I might add scenes where the robot has to reach a certain value in a specific trait in order to unlock a scene.

Most of my issues with the code stemmed from computer issues, such as not being able to commit or pull any files from github. I was finally able to commit on 1/23/20. On 1/26/20, my computer's drivers were preventing any input or outputs. I had to do a hard reset and lost progress despite my files being saved. The setbacks made me realize that only a demo is possible at this point in time, although I would like to add minigames and more content in the future.
